# Zepto_Project_Data_Analysis
Built a PostgreSQL database to analyze Zeptoâ€™s e-commerce inventory dataset. Cleaned data by handling nulls, removing invalid prices, and converting paise to rupees. Performed EDA on categories, stock, and duplicates. Wrote SQL queries to uncover insights on discounts, revenue, inventory weight, and value-for-money products.
